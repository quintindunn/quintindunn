### Hi there üëã

#### My name is Quintin Dunn, I'm a self-taught developer, practicing for over 8 years now. I've always loved coding since I was around 8 years old, I've now been a python developer for around 5 years. I'm fluent in Python, Javascript, and Java. I also have a decent amount of practice in C#, Lua, and C/C++

- üî≠ I'm currently working on [StringArtRobot](https://github.com/quintindunn/stringArtRobot/) a robot to convert a picture into string art.
- üï• I've always loved coding since the age of around 8, I've now been a python developer for around 5 years. I'm fluent in Python, Javascript, and Java.

- üè´ I'm currently in high School, I've taken and am taking a variety of AP classes including
  - AP Biology
  - AP Chemistry
  - AP Computer Science A
  - AP Physics 1

#### My favorite projects
 - [StringArtRobot](https://github.com/quintindunn/StringArtRobot) - Design for a Robot + Firmware for the automated generation of string art.
 - [OWS](https://github.com/quintindunn/OWS) - An open source web crawler, which follows robots.txt specification written in Python.
 - [ShedLock](https://github.com/quintindunn/ShedLock) - The design for feature rich smart lock built for my workshop.
 - [LapsePy](https://github.com/quintindunn/lapsepy) - An unoffical API wrapper for the social media app Lapse with a ton of functionality.

#### Other Adventures:
I have a major interest both within the coding ecosystem and outside of it, though most of my interests rest in one form of engineering or another. While my other projects havent been documented nearly as well and in most cases not at all.

Some of my most recent projects include:
- [StringArtRobot](https://github.com/quintindunn/StringArtRobot) - Design for a Robot + Firmware for the automated generation of string art.
- A new more compact HHO generater with better thermals, & overall energy efficency.
- A Musical Tesla Coil
