### Hi there üëã

#### My name is Quintin Dunn, I'm a self-taught developer, practicing for over 8 years now. I've loved coding since I was around 8 years old, I've now been a developer specializing in Python for around 5 years. I'm fluent in Python, Javascript, and Java. I also have a decent amount of practice in C/C++, C#, and Lua.

- üî≠ I'm currently working on `JEWAL`, a data collection and analytics tool.
- üï• I've always loved coding since the age of around 8, and I've now been a Python developer for around 5 years. I'm fluent in Python, Javascript, and Java.
- üì´ Reach me by email at [dunnquintin07@gmail.com](mailto:dunnquintin07@gmail.com)
- üè´ I'm currently in high school, I've taken and am taking a variety of AP classes including
  - AP Biology
  - AP Chemistry
  - AP Computer Science A
  - AP Physics 1
  - AP Statistics

#### My favorite projects
 - [StringArtRobot](https://github.com/quintindunn/StringArtRobot) - Design files + Firmware a robot for automated fabrication of string art.
 - [OWS](https://github.com/quintindunn/OWS) - An open-source web crawler, which follows robots.txt specification written in Python.
 - [ShedLock](https://github.com/quintindunn/ShedLock) - The design for a feature-rich smart lock built for my workshop.
 - [LapsePy](https://github.com/quintindunn/lapsepy) - An unofficial API wrapper for the social media app Lapse with a ton of functionality.

#### Other Adventures:
- I am highly interested in both the coding ecosystem and outside of it, though most of my interests involve engineering.
- My other projects have not been documented nearly as well, and in most cases, not at all.

Some of my most recent projects that aren't strictly software-related include:
- [StringArtRobot](https://github.com/quintindunn/StringArtRobot) - Design for a Robot + Firmware for the automated generation of string art.
- A new more compact HHO generator with better thermals, & overall energy efficiency.
- A custom designed Tesla Coil that can play music.
