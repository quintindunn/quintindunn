### Hi there 👋

#### My name is Quintin Dunn, I'm a self-taught developer, practicing for over 8 years now. I've always loved coding since I was around 8 years old, I've now been a python developer for around 5 years. I'm fluent in Python, Javascript, and Java. I also have a decent amount of practice in C#, Lua, and know the tip of the iceberg with C/C++

- 🔭 I'm currently working on [Open Web Search](https://github.com/quintindunn/OWS) a open source web crawler with page ranking, and searching.
- 🦀 I want to learn Rust

- 🏫 I'm currently in high School, I've taken and am taking a variety of AP classes including
  - AP Biology
  - AP Chemistry
  - AP Computer Science A
  - AP Physics 1 (ongoing)

#### Other Adventures:
I have a major interest both within the coding ecosystem and outside of it, though most of my interests rest in one form of engineering or another. While my other projects havent been documented nearly as well and in most cases not at all.

Some of my most recent projects include:
- [A lock for my workshop](https://github.com/quintindunn/ShedLock)
- A HHO generator
- Tesla Coil
